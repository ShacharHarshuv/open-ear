  In this exercise you will be given a series of chords (cadence) to establish a
  tonal center. Then a note (or a series of notes) will be played and you will
  be asked to find the scale degree of the note.
</p>

<app-info-panel>
  <b>Tip!</b> If you're just starting out, it's better to practice on just a few
  scale degrees. Starting from Do, Re and Mi is recommended.

  <h2>Scales and scale degrees</h2>
  <p>
    The major scale consist of 7 notes that are built from the following
    intervals:
  </p>
  <app-info-panel>
    tone - tone - semitone - tone - tone - tone - semitone
  </app-info-panel>
  <p>For example, the C major scale, consists of the following notes:</p>
  <app-info-panel> C D E F G A B </app-info-panel>
  <p>
    The first note of the scale - also called the tonic - is the "home" note.
    The note that will feel most "resolves" and at "rest".
  </p>
  <p>
    Any other note will have a specific "tension" or "sensation" in relation to
    the tonic note. It might feel as if the note "wants" to resolve to the tonic
    note.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example a group of chords will be played to let your mind feel C as
    the "root note". Then the note D will be played, listen to its sense of
    tension, like it wants to resolve down to C.
  </p>
  <ion-button [color]="'light'" [appPlayOnClick]="resolutionOfReInC">
    Play
  </ion-button>
  <p>
    In the key of D however, D is the tonic, so it assumes a sensation of rest.
    To avoid confusion between different keys, <b>we use solfege syllables.</b>
  </p>
  <p>Each syllable represents a different <b>degree</b> in the scale.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Do</b> - 1st Degree (C in C major)</li>
    <li><b>Re</b> - 2nd Degree (D in C major)</li>
    <li><b>Mi</b> - 3rd Degree (E in C major)</li>
    <li><b>Fa</b> - 4th Degree (F in C major)</li>
    <li><b>Sol</b> - 5th Degree (G in C major)</li>
    <li><b>La</b> - 6th Degree (A in C major)</li>
    <li><b>Ti</b> - 7th Degree (B in C major)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After getting a correct answer, the app will play a resolution of the note
    to the tonic, to enforce your memory and sensation of tension and release.

    If you're finding it hard to accomplish, try sing the note and resolve it to
    the nearest tonic, either above or below.
