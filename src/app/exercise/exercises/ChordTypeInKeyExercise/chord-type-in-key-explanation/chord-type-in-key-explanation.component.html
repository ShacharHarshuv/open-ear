<p>
  In this exercise you will be required to identify the type of a chord being
  played (Like Major vs Minor).
</p>

    >Tip! Major chords tend to sound "brighter" and minor chords tend to sound
    "darker".</b
  >
  But beware - the feeling of the chord also depends on context.

<p>
  By default, all chords in this exercise will be <b>from the same key</b> (i.e.
  diatonic) - This is recommended as it simulates a more musical scenario where
  chords are not random. You can change that in the settings.
