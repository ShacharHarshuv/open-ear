  In this exercise you will be given a series of chords (cadence) to establish a
  tonal center. Then a chord would be played, and you will be asked to pick the
  roman analysis (degree) of the chord in the context of the key.

  <b>Tip!</b> Every chord has its own sensation of tension/release. The 'I'
  chord feels most at rest, while the 'V' has tension - it "wants" to move.

  <h2>Triads & Roman Numerals</h2>
  <p>Triadic chords are chords built from 3 notes using thirds.</p>
  <p>For example, in the key of C major, we can form this chord:</p>
  <app-info-panel> <b>C</b> D <b>E</b> F <b>G</b> A B </app-info-panel>
  <p>
    Because it is built starting from the first degree (Tonic note)
    <b>it is called the 'I' (one) chord</b>. The 'I' chord is most "at rest",
    and holds no tension.
  </p>
  <ion-button [color]="'light'" [appPlayOnClick]="cadenceAndIChord">
    Cadence + 'I' chord
  </ion-button>
  <p>
    We can also build a triad from the 5th degree to form a 'V' (five) chord.
    Notice how this chord holds tension, and wants to resolve to the tonic.
  </p>
  <ion-button [color]="'light'" [appPlayOnClick]="cadenceAndVChord">
    Cadence + 'V' chord
  </ion-button>
  <p>
    Because the chord sensation is dependant on the key, we use Roman numerals
    to indicate chords numbers in an arbitrary key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that we use lower-case to indicate the minor chords (ii, iii and vi),
    and dim to indicate diminished chords (viidim)
