## OpenEar: Privacy policy

Welcome to OpenEar app!

This is an open source app developed by Shachar Har-Shuv. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

Starting with version 1.10 the app will collect anonymous usage data for research purposes. You can see detailed information about what is being collected and how here: https://github.com/ShacharHarshuv/open-ear/pull/277. Data is collected in such a way that it's impossible to find out a specific user activity. All other user data (including user preferences etc) is stored locally on the device and is erased when uninstalling the app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please email me.

Yours sincerely,  
Shachar Har-Shuv.
