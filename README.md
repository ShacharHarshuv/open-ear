OpenEar is an open source ear training app for musicians. It's goal is to provide a flexible variety of exercises so musicians will be able to master recognizing any musical pattern that might help them become better musicians.

Currently includes the following built in exercises:

1. Scale degree / melodic recognition for any mode / scale including chromatic notes (fully customizable).
2. Recognizing of chord functions (Roman numeral analysis) for every triad (major, minor, diminished) in every mode / scale. (fully customizable)
3. Common progressions - choose out of a set of super common progressions (like I V iv IV) to learn to identify them.
4. Chord progressions in real songs (currently available for android only) - this will play songs directly from YouTube and ask you to identify to Roman numeral analysis of their chord progression. This is a great way to practice with real music in a fun way. (I've included many very popular songs that uses very popular chord progressions, I hope more can be added in the future)
5. "Notes with Chords" exercise - this is a less familiar exercise in which you ear both a note in the scale an a chord, and you're required to say what scale degree it is and what chord degree it is. It's incredibly powerful in understanding the different colors a single note can have when it's played over different chords, and in my experience help develop not only melodic recognition but also harmonic recognition.
6. Recognition of chord types (major / minor) in a diatonic context. This is really useful if the chord functions exercise is a bit too difficult for you. I hope more chord types and customability can be added to this in the future.
7. Interval recognition - the very popular exercise almost all app has. Although I do not recommend using it as I find it inaffective in confusing, since the intervals are out-of-context.

## Donations

OpenEar has a paypal page you can donate money to: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=2WH25GBMCJTJS. All donations will be used for maintainance and development of the app. Any sum is appreciated.

## Contribution

OpenEar app is built in Angular using the Ionic library. It uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to generate sounds.
The easiest way to contribute to OpenEar is creating some new exercises on the existing infra.
To contribute follow the following steps.

- Fork the repository
- Open the repository root
- Download and install node at https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (If not already installed)
- Install ionic globally by running `npm i @ionic/cli -g`
- Install yarn globally by running `npm install --global yarn` (If not already installed)
- At the repository root directory run `yarn`
- Run `yarn start`
- App should be served in the browser!

To implement new exercises, you need to implement the type `Exercise.IExercise` interface. This is typically done by writing a factory function that uses utility functions like createExercise and composeExercise. See examples of using the factory functions under src/app/exercise/exercises.
After implementing you will need to add it to `ExerciseService#_exerciseList`.

If you would like to contribute in adding some features to the core infra of the app, you can do so as well. Here is a quick description of the infra:

- PlayerService is a wrapper on Tone.js that enables playing parts and return a promise that resolves when the part completed playing.
- ExerciseStateService manages the state of the exercise, including user actions (like answering, requesting repeat etc.). This does not hold any UI element.
- ExercisePage is the UI part of ExerciseStateService, and it manages rendering the UI, getting user input and displaying any indication.
- Under src/app/exercise you will also find a "utility" folder that has a tone of musical utilities like generating scales, chord progression etc. You can also convert notes to numbers to make calculation to them etc.

### Version Management

The version name is in the `package.json`, and currently needs to be changed manually using the following convention:

- Each version has a major, minor and patch numbers, like so: `{major}.{minor}.{patch}`.
- When making a new feature or fixing a bug (anything that changes app behavior) the patch number should be incremented. Building a tag for the version is optional.
- When releasing a new version, the minor should be incremented, and a tag for release should be created (i.e. `v1.2.3`)
- The major number is reserved for big changes.
- When building the app, the version needs to be set manually in the apk. (In the future we hope to automate that process).
